While this gives a sense of freedom to many users, others are not sure what they are choosing for, therefore making all choices less important. I am happy that each choice has a consequence. What they select will shape how they see this data and I hope will help inform them on this topic that is important to me and many others.\n",

    "Additionally, as cheesy as it sounds, I am proud of what I had learned. Though most of the code is not complicated by any means, it took me many many hours to get to this point. Anyone who codes knows that sometimes something that is actually only a few lines long may actually have taken hours upon hours. This was the case for much of this project. There are many lines that I am happy with because of how simple they are. A clean simple workspace makes me much more proud than one that is very complicated but also near impossible to follow. "

However, if there is much more data, things average out can you can see real trends that are happening. Additionally, I would like to include statistics to see how things actually compare. Lastly, after I am more familiar with ecological models, I would like to apply all of this info and try to forcast the future of the flowering dates of species based on certain parameters.\n",

I should find more data from other databases to offset this, because obviously mostly high-income neighborhoods are not representative of California."

    "Another thing that I learned that relates to the first point is data cleaning. I have found that raw data is never clean. It sucks. But with this new experience of cleaning many, many, many datasets, I am now more familiar with how most are set up, and that makes cleaning each dataset quicker each time. \n",
    "Lastly, helping us set up our github account and getting familiar with it is probably the most important thing I learned from this class.
