In this blog post, I will demonstrate webscraping using the scrapy package. We will be taking all of the actors of my favorite TV show, Narcos: Mexico, and attempt to recommend shows based on how many actors from the orginal show the new shows share. 

## Webscraping
Webscraping is a powerful tool that makes it easy to 'scrape' information off of a website in which the data that you want is not in a format that is easy to recieve. I will demostrate my method of recieving the shows that all the actors of Narcos: Mexico have been on, and visualizing that in an attractive plot.

### The parse Function

The parse function will utilize the starting url (in our case it is the home page for Narcos: Mexico on IMBD). It will then navigate to the Cast & Crew page so we can see every actor that appeared in this series. The comments in the function will walk through this in more detail.


```python
def parse(self, response):
    '''
    Redirect scraper to webpage of full cast and crew of desired TV show 
    (under assumption you start on the TV Show's main IMDB page)

    @param self
    @param response: represents the website
    @yield: redirection to full cast and crew site
    '''
    
    #find where there is a hyperlink on the subgroup titled "Top Cast"
    topCst = response.css("div.ipc-title__wrapper a").attrib["href"] 

    #if it exists, take that link embedded in the hyperlink and
    #redirect scraper there
    if topCst:
        topCst = response.urljoin(topCst)

        yield scrapy.Request(topCst, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

### The parse_full_credits Function

The parse_full_credits function works only if it is called on the Cast & Crew page. It will go through the page and redirect through to each actor's main page. The comments in the function will walk through this in more detail.


```python
    def parse_full_credits(self, response):
        '''
        Redirect sraper to actor's main webpage of each actor selected

        @param self
        @param response: represents the website
        @yield: redirection to actor main webpage
        '''

        #put actor name/ hyperlink in a list for all actors in the full cast and crew
        actLst = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]

        #redirect to the actor page for each actor in the list
        for actor in actLst:
            actrPg = response.urljoin(actor)
            yield scrapy.Request(actrPg, callback = self.parse_actor_page) 
```

### The parse_actor_page Function

The parse_actor_page function will only work if it is called on the actor's main webpage. It will yield a dictionary of the actor's name and every show that they have appeared in. The comments in the function will walk through this in more detail.


```python
    def parse_actor_page(self, response):
        '''
        Add to dictionary of every actor and every work they have acted in 

        @param self
        @param response: represents the website        
        @yield: adds dictionary  names and the works they have appeared in
        '''

        #grab the actors name
        actNam = response.css('title::text').get()[0:-7]
        
        #list of every work they have been apart of (producing, acting, etc...)
        flmLst = response.xpath("//*[@class='filmo-category-section']/div/b/a/text()").extract()
        
        #take the number of acting credits they have from 'Acting' tab
        #try with 'actor' tag, if that doesn't work, try with 'actress'
        #this depends on the individuals webpage
        try:
            actNum = int(response.xpath("//*[@id='filmo-head-actor']/text()").extract()[-1][2:-10])
        except:
            actNum = int(response.xpath("//*[@id='filmo-head-actress']/text()").extract()[-1][2:-10])

        #takes only the first actNum of works they been in, because this is the works they have acted in
        actLst = flmLst[:actNum]

        #yeild dictionary of the actors and a list of all their works
        yield {"actor" : actNam, "movie_or_TV_name" : actLst}        
```

## Data Visualization

To show that this works, we can put a little bar graph together that shows that our web scraping has worked.

First, we'll see how the top 20 choices fair against each other...

![sharedActors1.png](/images/sharedActors1.png)

Well, I guess I should have seen that coming... Of course the most shared show is the one that they were all on! Let's exclude that and look again.

![sharedActors2.png](/images/sharedActors2.png)

Much better! We know now that our algorithm recommends... Como dice el Dicho? y La Rosa de Guadelupe? I mean I guess it makes sense that they have been on telenovelas together. Mexican soap operas run constantly and for a long time, so statistically it makes plenty o' sense.

Well with that realization... we now know how to webscrape using scrapy!
